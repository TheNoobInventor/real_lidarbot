# Real Lidarbot

ROS2 Foxy, running on Ubuntu server 20.04 on a Raspberry Pi 4, is employed in controlling a physical 2 wheeled drive vehicle. An RPLIDAR A1 sensor is used for obstacle avoidance and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) operations. For added functionality, the vehicle can be controlled with a joystick game controller.
